## Customizing the Map

You can customize the embedded map by adjusting options in Google Maps before copying the iframe code:

- **Map Size**: Change the width and height values
- **Zoom Level**: Adjust how close the map is zoomed in
- **Map Type**: Choose between standard map, satellite, or terrain views
- **Pin Placement**: Ensure your location marker is correctly positioned

## Troubleshooting

If the map doesn't appear correctly:

- Check that the iframe HTML code was pasted correctly
- Verify that there are no syntax errors in the iframe code
- Make sure your website allows iframes
- Clear your browser cache to see the updated map

## Mobile Responsiveness

For better mobile experience, you may want to ensure your iframe is responsive. The eBroker platform should handle this automatically, but if you're customizing the code, consider adding responsive styling.
