## Key Color Elements

The eBroker web application allows you to customize several color elements:

- **Primary Color**: Used for main UI elements, buttons, and highlights
- **Secondary Color**: Used for accents and secondary UI elements
- **Text Colors**: For various text elements throughout the application
- **Background Colors**: For different sections and components

## Color Selection Tips

When selecting colors for your web application:

- Use colors that match your brand identity
- Ensure sufficient contrast for readability
- Limit your color palette to 2-3 main colors for a clean look
- Consider color psychology (e.g., blue for trust, green for growth)
- Test your color choices on different devices and screen sizes

## Applying Color Changes

After setting your custom colors:

1. Save your changes in the admin panel
2. The changes will be reflected in your web application automatically
3. You may need to clear your browser cache to see the updated colors

## Advanced Customization

For more advanced color customization beyond what's available in the admin panel, you may need to modify your CSS files. However, this requires development knowledge and should be done carefully to avoid breaking the layout or functionality.
